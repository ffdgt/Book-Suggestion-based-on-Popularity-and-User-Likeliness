## ***Book Recommendation System***

A **machine learning-based book recommendation engine** that suggests books to users based on two distinct approaches: a **popularity-based model** and a **collaborative filtering model**. The system processes a large dataset of books, user ratings, and user information to provide personalized and accurate recommendations. The project is built using Python, focusing on data manipulation with **pandas** and machine learning with **scikit-learn**.

***

### **Key Features and Technical Highlights**

* **Dual Recommendation Strategy:** The system utilizes both a **popularity-based** model (recommending top-rated, widely-read books) and a **collaborative filtering** model (recommending books based on user-to-user similarity). This hybrid approach provides diverse and relevant suggestions.
* **Data-Driven Methodology:** The project demonstrates proficiency in the complete data science pipeline, including **data ingestion**, **data cleaning**, and **feature engineering**. It specifically addresses data type inconsistencies with a `DtypeWarning` and confirms no duplicate book entries.
* **Collaborative Filtering Implementation:** A key feature is the creation of a **user-item matrix** and the use of **cosine similarity** from the **scikit-learn** library to find the most similar books. This showcases an understanding of key recommendation system algorithms.
* **Model Optimization:** The system is optimized by focusing on **"power users"** (users who have rated over 200 books) and **"famous books"** (books with over 50 ratings). This reduces noise and improves the quality of recommendations.
* **Scalable Architecture:** The final dataframes and the trained model are saved using the **`pickle`** library, enabling rapid loading and efficient predictions without re-running the entire data processing pipeline.

### **Getting Started**

#### **Prerequisites**

* Python 3.x
* pip (Python package installer)

#### **Installation**

1.  **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/yourusername/book-recommender-system.git](https://github.com/yourusername/book-recommender-system.git)
    cd book-recommender-system
    ```
2.  **(Optional but recommended) Create and activate a virtual environment**:
    ```bash
    # For macOS/Linux
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    
    # For Windows
    python -m venv venv
    venv\Scripts\activate
    ```
3.  **Install the required packages**:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

***

### **How to Use**

1.  **Launch the Jupyter Notebook**:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook
    ```
2.  Open the `book-recommender-system.ipynb` file in your browser.
3.  Run all the cells in the notebook to see the data processing, model training, and recommendation functions in action. You can use the `recommend()` function at the end of the notebook to get suggestions for any book title from the dataset.
